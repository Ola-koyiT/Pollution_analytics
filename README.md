# 🌍 Clearing the Air: Insights into India's Air Quality Crisis  
---

## 📖 Project Overview  

India faces severe air pollution challenges, significantly impacting public health and the environment.  
This project provides an analytical review of India's air quality, identifying the most hazardous pollutants,  
mapping them by city, and highlighting pollution trends over time.  

The Power BI dashboard visualizes key insights, enabling data-driven decision-making for policymakers,  
environmentalists, and researchers.  

### 🔍 **Key Metrics Analyzed:**  
✔️ **Pollutants Categories:** Respiratory, Carcinogenic, Greenhouse gases  
✔️ **Air Quality Index (AQI):** Most & least polluted cities  
✔️ **Quarterly PM Levels:** Seasonal variations  
✔️ **Geospatial Mapping:** Top pollutants by city

## 📊 Dashboard Insights & Analysis  

### **1️⃣ Respiratory Pollutants**  
The three main pollutants affecting respiratory health:  
- **Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂):** `37.2%`  
- **Ozone (O₃):** `44.36%`  
- **Sulfur Dioxide (SO₂):** `18.44%`  

✅ **Insight:**  
Ozone (O₃) is the dominant respiratory pollutant, increasing risks of lung diseases like asthma and bronchitis.  

---

### **2️⃣ Carcinogenic Pollutants**  
Pollutants linked to long-term cancer risks:  
- **Toluene:** `63.92%`  
- **Xylene:** `17.75%`  
- **Benzene:** `18.33%`  

✅ **Insight:**  
Toluene is the most abundant carcinogen, mainly from industrial emissions and vehicular exhaust.  

---

### **3️⃣ Greenhouse Pollutants**  
Major contributors to climate change:  
- **Nitrogen Oxides (NOₓ):** `96.4%`  
- **Carbon Dioxide (CO₂):** `3.6%`  

✅ **Insight:**  
Nitrogen oxides (NOₓ) are the dominant greenhouse pollutants, contributing to smog and environmental degradation.

## 🏙️ Air Quality Index (AQI) Insights  

### **🌆 Most Polluted Cities (Higher AQI = Worse Air Quality)**  
1. **Delhi** - `251.83`  
2. **Patna** - `169.36`  
3. **Amritsar** - `129.17`  

✅ **Insight:**  
- Delhi has the worst air quality due to traffic congestion, industrial emissions, and seasonal crop burning.  

---

### **🌿 Least Polluted Cities (Lower AQI = Cleaner Air)**  
1. **Hyderabad** - `104.86`  
2. **Amaravati** - `101.50`  
3. **Chandigarh** - `93.24`  

✅ **Insight:**  
- Chandigarh and Hyderabad have relatively better air quality due to urban planning and green spaces.  

---

## ⏳ Seasonal Trends: Particulate Matter Analysis  

📊 **Quarterly AQI Trends:**  
- **Q1:** High pollution (~70 AQI)  
- **Q2:** Significant drop (~30 AQI)  
- **Q3:** Lowest pollution (~25-30 AQI)  
- **Q4:** Sharp increase (~90 AQI)  

✅ **Insight:**  
Pollution peaks in winter (Q4), possibly due to crop burning and temperature inversion effects.

## 🗺️ Geospatial Mapping of Top Pollutants  

The dashboard maps the top **3 pollutants** for major Indian cities:  

📍 **Cities Mapped:**  
- **Delhi, Kolkata, Patna, Hyderabad, Chandigarh, Amritsar**  

🛑 **Dominant Pollutants:** NO₂, O₃, SO₂  

✅ **Insight:**  
- Northern cities show the highest pollution, correlating with industrialization and high vehicular density.
